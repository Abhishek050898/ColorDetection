# ColorDetection
Color detection is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps. I write a simple Python code to detect the color in the image using OpenCV and pandas (python libraries).

Color detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Simple isnâ€™t it? Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. 
Our brain then recognizes the color.

#About Project
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
